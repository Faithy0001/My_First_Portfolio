    <h1>Welcome to My First Webpage</h1>
    
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Faith Okpoyo, and I'm learning frontend web development. This is my first webpage, and I'm excited to share my journey with you.</p>
    <p>I'm currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Every day, I'm getting better at building things for the web.</p>
    
    <h3>My Learning Goals</h3>
    <p>I want to become a skilled frontend developer who can build beautiful and functional websites. I'm practicing every day and pushing my code to GitHub.</p>
    <p>This webpage is just the beginning. Soon, I'll be adding more projects and showcasing everything I've learned.</p>
